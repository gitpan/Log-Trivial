Log::Trivial Version 0.40
=========================

This is "Yet Another" simple module to write trivial
log files. At the moment please treat this code as
BETA grade only.

There are LOTS of other log writing modules on CPAN,
please check them all carefully before installing
this one.

WARNING: This module needs a POSIX like operating
system for full function, which means it not every
function is supported on Windows, though it has been
tested on Cygwin/Win2K.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

or
   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires only core modules:
    Perl 5.10.x
    strict
    warnings

It will probably work on older perls but I do not have them to test
with anymore.

The tests will use non-core modules if available
but these are not required for normal use.
